# Brython Editor for PlantUML

Welcome to the **Brython Editor**, a project aimed at integrating [Brython](https://brython.info/) with [PlantUML](https://plantuml.com/) to provide a seamless and powerful online diagramming tool.

## What is Brython?

Brython is an implementation of Python that runs in the browser. It allows developers to write Python code that interacts with HTML and JavaScript, making it a great tool for those who prefer Python over JavaScript for web development. By combining the power of Python with the web, Brython opens up a lot of possibilities for dynamic web applications.

## Why PlantUML?

[PlantUML](https://plantuml.com/) is a powerful tool for creating UML diagrams from plain text descriptions. It supports a wide variety of diagram types, including class diagrams, sequence diagrams, use case diagrams, and more. With PlantUML, you can visualize complex systems and architectures with ease. Some key benefits of using PlantUML include:
- **Simplicity**: Create complex diagrams with simple text descriptions.
- **Flexibility**: Supports many types of diagrams, from UML to flowcharts, and more.
- **Integration**: PlantUML can be integrated with many tools and platforms, making it versatile for various workflows.

## The Future of the Brython Editor

This **Brython Editor** will eventually replace the old editor currently hosted at [https://www.plantuml.com/plantuml](https://www.plantuml.com/plantuml). The goal is to provide a faster, more interactive, and user-friendly experience for creating PlantUML diagrams directly in your browser. With Brython, users will benefit from the flexibility of Python, eliminating the limitations of the current editor, which relies heavily on JavaScript and legacy architecture.
